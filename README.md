# ECG Lead Reconstruction Reconstructing a full 12-lead ECG from reduced leads (I, II, and V4). ## Overview This project implements a system to reconstruct all 12 standard ECG leads from a reduced set: - Leads I and II are used to deterministically calculate limb leads (III, aVR, aVL, aVF) using Einthoven's and Goldberger's laws - A deep learning model (1D U-Net) is used to reconstruct the remaining precordial leads (V1, V2, V3, V5, V6) from I, II, and V4 ## Dataset We use the [PTB-XL dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/), which contains 21,837 clinical 12-lead ECG recordings. ## Getting Started 1. Clone this repository 2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 3. Prepare data: `./scripts/prepare_data.sh /path/to/ptb-xl /path/to/output` 4. Run baseline: `./scripts/train_baseline.sh` ## Project Structure - `data/`: Data preparation and loading - `src/`: Core implementation (models, evaluation) - `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and testing - `scripts/`: Utility scripts - `docs/`: Project documentation ## Presentation A comprehensive LaTeX Beamer presentation is available in `presentation_slides.tex`. ### Compiling the Presentation **Prerequisites**: LaTeX installation (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX) **Automatic compilation**: ```bash ./compile_presentation.sh ``` **Manual compilation**: ```bash pdflatex presentation_slides.tex pdflatex presentation_slides.tex # Run twice for references ``` The presentation includes: - Project overview and motivation - Technical methodology (physics + deep learning) - Model architecture and training details - Preliminary results on synthetic data - Clinical impact and future work ### Presentation Figures Figures are automatically generated using: ```bash python scripts/generate_presentation_plots.py ``` This creates visualizations in `docs/figures/` including: - ECG signal reconstructions - Performance metrics plots - Lead comparison examples
